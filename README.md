## User walk-through with game logic

(Section will be deleted)

- As a user, I should be able to see a start screen with three universes to choose from

  - When I click on a chosen universe, it should be highlighted as my option
  - When I click the start button, I should then be taken to the Game Screen with my chosen universe as a parameter

- As a user, when the Game Screen loads, I should be presented with two randomized characters with health bars displayed above them and a number of buttons that I will use to attack the opponent with

  - When I click one of the buttons, if my power stat is higher than my opponent, then I will win that round and my opponent will lose a life
    - Buttons: Intelligence, Strength, Speed, Durability, Power, Combat
  - When I click on a button, if my power stat is lower than my opponent, then i will lose that round and lose a life
    - To symbolise a successful attack, I will hear a success sound effect
  - If my opponent loses 3 times, then they will be defeated and I will be presented with another opponent
    - To symbolise an unsuccessful attack, I will hear an unsuccessful sound effect
  - If I lose 3 times, then I will lose the game and will be presented with the Final Screen page

- As a user, when the Final Screen loads, I will be presented with a final score of how many opponents I have defeated, where I will have the option of whether I want to input my Initials and submit a Highscore

  - When I click on the Play Again button, I will be presented with the Start Screen
  - If I have inputted my Initials and clicked on the Highscores button, I will be presented with the Highscore Screen

- As a User, when the Highscores Screen loads, I will be able to see the Highscores from previous users
